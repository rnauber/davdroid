Release 4.3.5.1
-------------------

This release fixes a number of issues related to Android specific modifications made to
the original HttpClient 4.3.5 code used as a base for the Android port.

Please note that as of this release HttpClient disables all versions of SSL (including SSLv3)
in favor of the TLS protocol by default. Those users who wish to continue using SSLv3 need
to explicitly enable support for it.

Users of all versions of Apache HttpClient 4.3 port for Android are advised to upgrade.
